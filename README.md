## Norwegian mini grammar for russian speakers

It is not always easy to find Norwegian (Nynorsk) grammar for English speakers, and it is even harder when one neither speaks nor understands English. My project aims at helping native Russian speakers to improve their knowledge of Nynorsk by providing them with grammar rules explained in Russian. 

### Project details

Website is built using React. The grammar rules are classified as parts of speech (PoS) and stored as Markdown in the [data folder](https://github.com/goudbes/nynorskpaarussisk/tree/master/src/data).
